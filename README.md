## 🚨 Project Status: Proof of Concept

**Important**: MPL is currently a research prototype demonstrating that programming languages can be built from mathematical notation. We have implemented a working M0 parser that validates the concept, but **programs cannot yet be executed**. This is a vision project seeking contributors to help build the interpreter and runtime.

### What Works Today ✅

Every item below is enforced by [CI](.github/workflows/ci.yml) on every push:

- An ANTLR 4 grammar built from mathematical symbols that compiles with zero errors and zero warnings (warnings are treated as errors)
- All 10 [example programs](examples/) parse (`./gradlew parseExamples`)
- A test suite covering the lexer, the parser, the examples, and every ```` ```mpl ```` code block in this README (`./gradlew test`)
- An ASCII escape sequence for every Unicode symbol ([glyph-escapes.md](glyph-escapes.md))

### What Doesn't Work Yet 🚧
- **No interpreter** - Programs parse but don't run
- **No type checking** - Types are recognized but not validated
- **No standard library** - No built-in functions
- **No tooling** - Basic parser only

## Vision: Programming Without Language Barriers

In a world where 80% of humanity doesn't speak English, why should programming—the literacy of the 21st century—require it? MPL demonstrates that we can build programming languages using mathematical symbols that children already understand, making computational thinking accessible to billions previously excluded by language barriers.

**This is cognitive justice in action.**

## 🎯 The Fatima test


> "Why do I need to know English to write a program?" — Fatima, 10 years old, Cairo

Every design decision in MPL must pass one simple test: **Can a 10-year-old non-English speaker understand this?**

### Traditional programming
```python
# English required:
for n in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
    print(n * n)
```

### MPL - Universal understanding
```mpl
-- Mathematical symbols only:
∀ n ∈ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] : ✎(n × n)
```

If Fatima can't understand it with her basic math knowledge, we redesign it. No exceptions.

## 🔮 How it works

### For everyone
Write code using mathematical symbols instead of English words. It's that simple.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          Mathematical Notation              │
│    λn: (n ≤ 1 ⟹ 1) | (n × fact(n-1))       │
└────────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                 │
                 ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Unicode Input                     │
│    (Visual palette, voice, keyboard)        │
└────────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                 │
                 ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          ANTLR 4 Parser                     │
│         Lexer → Parser → AST                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Five ways to write λ (lambda)

Today the parser accepts two spellings of every symbol: the Unicode glyph (λ) and its ASCII escape (`\lambda`). The rest are the input methods we envision tooling for:

1. **⌨️ Type** — `\lambda` (works today, in any editor)
2. **👆 Click** — Visual symbol palette (envisioned)
3. **🎤 Speak** — "Lambda" in ANY language (envisioned)
4. **✍️ Draw** — Handwriting recognition on tablets (envisioned)
5. **⚡ Shortcut** — Platform shortcuts (envisioned)

<details>
<summary>🔧 Technical details (click to expand)</summary>

### Unicode implementation
- Full Unicode support, including supplementary-plane symbols (𝓜, 𝔹, 🖫)
- Every glyph has exactly one ASCII escape ([glyph-escapes.md](glyph-escapes.md))

### Parser architecture
```
Input Methods → Unicode Stream → ANTLR 4 Lexer → Parse Tree
```
Type checking, optimization and code generation are planned, not built.

### Grammar specification
- Compiles with zero ANTLR errors and warnings (enforced in CI)
- Operator precedence documented in [precedence.csv](precedence.csv)
- [View full ANTLR grammar](src/main/antlr4/MPL.g4)

## ✨ Core features

### 🌐 Cognitive universality
**Mathematical symbols as humanity's common language**

- **No translation needed** — Math is already universal
- **Cultural neutrality** — No linguistic imperialism
- **Instant comprehension** — Symbols map to concepts directly

### 🎨 Multi-modal input (envisioned)
**Meet learners where they are**

Only ASCII escapes exist today; the rest is the tooling we want to build:

```
┌─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐
│   Visual    │    Voice    │  Keyboard   │ Handwriting │
│   Palette   │    Input    │   Escapes   │ Recognition │
├─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┤
│  Click λ    │ Say "lambda"│ Type \lambda│  Draw λ     │
│  from menu  │ in any lang │ (works now) │  on screen  │
└─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘
```

- **ASCII escapes** — `\lambda`, `\forall`, … work in any editor today
- **Visual palette** — Click symbols like emoji (envisioned)
- **Voice input** — Speak in your native language (envisioned)
- **Handwriting** — Natural for mathematical notation (envisioned)

### 📈 Progressive complexity
**From arithmetic to algorithms**

```mpl
-- Level 1: Basic math (everyone knows this!)
x ← 5 + 3;
y ← x × 2;

-- Level 2: Logic (learned in school)
x > 10 ∧ y < 20 ⟹ ✎"Success!";

-- Level 3: Advanced (natural progression)
squares ← 0;
∀ n ∈ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] : squares ← squares + n × n;
```

## 📊 Educational Vision

### The Problem We're Solving

Consider a hypothetical student, "Maria" from São Paulo:
- She loves math and logic puzzles
- She wants to learn programming
- But she must first memorize English keywords like `for`, `while`, `if`, `else`
- The Portuguese word "for" means "went" - adding confusion
- She spends more time translating than learning computational thinking

### What MPL Could Enable (Vision, Not Reality)

With MPL fully implemented, we envision students could:
- Write their first program in minutes using familiar mathematical symbols
- Focus on logic and problem-solving, not foreign vocabulary
- Learn alongside parents who also don't speak English
- Build confidence through immediate understanding

### Hypothetical Benefits We Aim For

If MPL were fully implemented and deployed in classrooms, we hypothesize it could achieve:

| Potential Metric | Traditional Approach | MPL Vision |
|-----------------|---------------------|------------|
| Time to understand loops | Days of memorizing `for` | Minutes with ∀ symbol |
| Cognitive load | High (translate + learn) | Lower (direct understanding) |
| Parent involvement | Limited by English | Possible with math symbols |

**Note: These are aspirational goals based on our hypothesis, not measured results.**

### Envisioned Success Stories

These are hypothetical scenarios we hope MPL could enable once fully implemented:

<details>
<summary>🌍 Imagine: A student's potential journey</summary>

We envision students could progress like this:

**Starting point**: Basic math knowledge, no English
```mpl
-- Month 1: First program using familiar symbols
✎"Jambo!"  -- Hello in their language
```

**Growing skills**: Applying math knowledge to programming
```mpl
-- Month 6: Using mathematical concepts they know
data ← [23, 45, 67, 34, 89, 12];
total ← 0;
∀ x ∈ data : total ← total + x;
average ← total ÷ 6;
✎("Average: " + average)
```

**Sharing knowledge**: Teaching others in their community

*This is our vision - not current reality. Help us make it possible!*

## 💻 Code examples (Syntax Demonstration)

**Note**: These examples show valid MPL syntax that our parser accepts (a test extracts every code block on this page and parses it). However, since we haven't built an interpreter yet, they cannot be executed.

Some notation you might expect from math class — ∑, √, ², `%` (modulo), |x|, ranges like [1..10] — is deliberately absent: it is deferred to milestone M1, where each symbol will arrive together with defined semantics (see [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md)).

### Level 1: Arithmetic thinking 🔢
*What every child knows*

```mpl
-- Store values (like math class!)
length ← 5;
width ← 3;
area ← length × width;
✎("Area = " + area);

-- Make decisions: (condition ⟹ result) | fallback
age ← 15;
(age ≥ 18 ⟹ ✎"Adult") | ✎"Minor";
```

### Level 2: Logical reasoning 🧩
*Natural progression from math*

```mpl
-- Do something for every element (∀ = "for all")
∀ n ∈ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] : ✎(n × n);

-- Accumulate a running total
total ← 0;
∀ n ∈ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] : total ← total + n;
✎("Total: " + total);
```

### Level 3: Real-world applications 🌍
*Solving community problems*

```mpl
-- Weather data analysis
temperatures ← [28, 30, 27, 31, 29, 33, 28];
total ← 0;
∀ t ∈ temperatures : total ← total + t;
μ ← total ÷ 7;
✎("Average: " + μ + "°C");

-- Parallel processing (‖ = parallel)
results ← analyzeNorth() ‖ analyzeSouth() ‖ analyzeEast();
```

### Level 4: Advanced concepts 🚀
*For those ready to go deeper*

```mpl
-- Function composition (∘, straight from math class)
double ≜ λn: n × 2;
addOne ≜ λn: n + 1;
transform ≜ double ∘ addOne;
✎(transform(5));

-- Higher-order functions
apply ≜ λf, x: f(x);
✎(apply(λn: n × n, 6));
```

## Why Release a Parser Without Execution?

We believe the core innovation of MPL is proving that mathematical notation can replace English keywords. By releasing the parser, we demonstrate this is grammatically possible and invite the community to help build the rest.

The parser alone proves several key points:
- Mathematical symbols can express the core programming constructs (see the ten [examples](examples/))
- A language without English keywords is technically feasible
- The grammar compiles with zero ANTLR errors and warnings, enforced in CI
- ASCII fallbacks make it universally typeable

Sometimes the idea is more important than the implementation. By sharing MPL now, we hope to inspire others to think differently about programming languages and who they exclude.

## 🏗️ Technical architecture

### Grammar specification

- Every symbol has exactly one meaning and one ASCII escape ([glyph-escapes.md](glyph-escapes.md))
- Operator precedence is documented in [precedence.csv](precedence.csv) and exercised by the test suite
- The grammar compiles with zero ANTLR errors and warnings (`-Werror`, enforced in CI)
- 200+ syntax assertions across the lexer, parser, example, and documentation test suites
- [Full grammar specification](src/main/antlr4/MPL.g4)

### Implementation stack

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          Input Layer (Multi-modal)          │

│          Code Generation (planned)          │
│   LLVM │ JVM │ JavaScript │ Python         │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Only the parser stage exists today; the lower stages are the planned architecture. We publish no performance numbers until CI measures them.

## 🌟 Why This Matters

### The Vision

Imagine a world where:
- A teacher in Beijing could explain loops using ∀ instead of `for`
- A parent in Mumbai could understand their child's code without knowing English
- Education ministers could provide programming education without requiring English literacy

These aren't testimonials - they're possibilities we're working toward. MPL is still just a parser, but it proves that programming without English is possible.

## 🚀 The inspiration

The idea for MPL came from a simple observation: children worldwide learn the same mathematical symbols (+, -, ×, ÷, =) but must learn English to program. This creates an unnecessary barrier.

Imagine a student asking: *"Why do I need to know English to tell a computer what to do? I know math. Isn't that enough?"*

This hypothetical question captures the essence of MPL. Mathematical thinking IS enough. We're building this proof of concept to demonstrate it's possible.

## 🔬 Cognitive science foundation

<details>
<summary>Why mathematical symbols work universally (click to expand)</summary>

### Symbolic universality

Mathematical notation evolved over millennia to be:
- **Culture-agnostic** — Symbols transcend linguistic boundaries
- **Cognitively efficient** — Direct concept-to-symbol mapping
- **Progressively learnable** — Builds on existing knowledge

### Neurological evidence

fMRI studies show mathematical symbol processing activates language-independent brain regions, enabling comprehension without linguistic translation.

### Pedagogical advantages

1. **Reduced cognitive load** — Single-step comprehension
2. **Transfer learning** — Math knowledge directly applies
3. **Cultural preservation** — Think in your native language
4. **Universal collaboration** — Code readable globally
