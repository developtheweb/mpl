## 🚨 Project Status: Proof of Concept

**Important**: MPL is currently a research prototype demonstrating that programming languages can be built from mathematical notation. We have implemented a complete parser that validates the concept, but **programs cannot yet be executed**. This is a vision project seeking contributors to help build the interpreter and runtime.

### What Works Today ✅
- Complete ANTLR 4 grammar with 70+ mathematical symbols
- Parser that successfully processes all major programming paradigms  
- Zero grammar ambiguities
- Comprehensive test suite validating syntax
- ASCII escape sequences for every Unicode symbol

### What Doesn't Work Yet 🚧
- **No interpreter** - Programs parse but don't run
- **No type checking** - Types are recognized but not validated
- **No standard library** - No built-in functions
- **No tooling** - Basic parser only

## Vision: Programming Without Language Barriers

In a world where 80% of humanity doesn't speak English, why should programming—the literacy of the 21st century—require it? MPL demonstrates that we can build programming languages using mathematical symbols that children already understand, making computational thinking accessible to billions previously excluded by language barriers.

**This is cognitive justice in action.**

## 🎯 The Fatima test

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/images/fatima-test.png" alt="The Fatima Test illustrated" width="600">
</div>

> "Why do I need to know English to write a program?" — Fatima, 10 years old, Cairo

Every design decision in MPL must pass one simple test: **Can a 10-year-old non-English speaker understand this?**

### Traditional programming
```python
# English required:
for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i)
```

### MPL - Universal understanding
```mpl
# Mathematical symbols only:
∀ i ∈ [0,10) :
    i % 2 = 0 ? 📤(i)
```

If Fatima can't understand it with her basic math knowledge, we redesign it. No exceptions.

## 🔮 How it works

### For everyone
Write code using mathematical symbols instead of English words. It's that simple.

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/images/transformation-pipeline.gif" alt="MPL transformation pipeline" width="800">
</div>

### Five ways to write λ (lambda)

1. **👆 Click** — Visual symbol palette
2. **⌨️ Type** — `\lambda` transforms automatically  
3. **🎤 Speak** — "Lambda" in ANY language (العربية, 中文, Español...)
4. **✍️ Draw** — Handwriting recognition on tablets
5. **⚡ Shortcut** — Platform shortcuts (Cmd+L, Alt+L)

### 📈 Progressive complexity
**From arithmetic to algorithms**

```mpl
# Level 1: Basic math (everyone knows this!)
x ← 5 + 3
y ← x × 2

# Level 2: Logic (learned in school)
x > 10 ∧ y < 20 ? 📤("Success!")

# Level 3: Advanced (natural progression)
∑(i ∈ [1,100] : i²) → result
```

## 📊 Educational Vision

### The Problem We're Solving

Consider a hypothetical student, "Maria" from São Paulo:
- She loves math and logic puzzles
- She wants to learn programming
- But she must first memorize English keywords like `for`, `while`, `if`, `else`
- The Portuguese word "for" means "went" - adding confusion
- She spends more time translating than learning computational thinking

### What MPL Could Enable (Vision, Not Reality)

With MPL fully implemented, we envision students could:
- Write their first program in minutes using familiar mathematical symbols
- Focus on logic and problem-solving, not foreign vocabulary
- Learn alongside parents who also don't speak English
- Build confidence through immediate understanding

### Hypothetical Benefits We Aim For

If MPL were fully implemented and deployed in classrooms, we hypothesize it could achieve:

| Potential Metric | Traditional Approach | MPL Vision |
|-----------------|---------------------|------------|
| Time to understand loops | Days of memorizing `for` | Minutes with ∀ symbol |
| Cognitive load | High (translate + learn) | Lower (direct understanding) |
| Parent involvement | Limited by English | Possible with math symbols |

**Note: These are aspirational goals based on our hypothesis, not measured results.**

### Envisioned Success Stories

These are hypothetical scenarios we hope MPL could enable once fully implemented:

<details>
<summary>🌍 Imagine: A student's potential journey</summary>

We envision students could progress like this:

**Starting point**: Basic math knowledge, no English
```mpl
# Month 1: First program using familiar symbols
📤("Jambo!")  # Hello in their language
```

**Growing skills**: Applying math knowledge to programming
```mpl
# Month 6: Using mathematical concepts they know
data ← [23, 45, 67, 34, 89, 12]
average ← (∑ x ∈ data : x) ÷ |data|
📤("Average: " + average)
```

**Sharing knowledge**: Teaching others in their community

*This is our vision - not current reality. Help us make it possible!*

## 💻 Code examples (Syntax Demonstration)

**Note**: These examples show valid MPL syntax that our parser accepts. However, since we haven't built an interpreter yet, they cannot be executed.

### Level 1: Arithmetic thinking 🔢
*What every child knows*

```mpl
# Store values (like math class!)
# This syntax is valid and will parse ✓
length ← 5
width ← 3
area ← length × width
📤("Area = " + area)

# Make decisions
# Parser accepts this, execution not implemented ✗
age ← 15
age ≥ 18 ? 📤("Adult") : 📤("Minor")
```

### Level 2: Logical reasoning 🧩
*Natural progression from math*

```mpl
# Find all even numbers (∀ = "for all")
∀ n ∈ [1,20] :
    n % 2 = 0 ? 📤(n)

# Sum of squares (just like ∑ in math!)
total ← ∑(i ∈ [1,10] : i²)
📤("Sum of squares: " + total)
```

### Level 3: Real-world applications 🌍
*Solving community problems*

```mpl
# Weather data analysis
temperatures ← [28, 30, 27, 31, 29, 33, 28]
μ ← (∑ t ∈ temperatures : t) ÷ |temperatures|
σ ← √((∑ t ∈ temperatures : (t - μ)²) ÷ |temperatures|)

📤("Average: " + μ + "°C")
📤("Std Dev: " + σ)

# Parallel processing (∥ = parallel)
results ← ∥ {
    α: analyzeRegionNorth()
    β: analyzeRegionSouth()
    γ: analyzeRegionEast()
}
```

### Level 4: Advanced concepts 🚀
*For those ready to go deeper*

```mpl
# Neural network layer (yes, AI in symbols!)
layer ← λ(W, b, x):
    σ(W × x + b)  # Matrix multiplication!
    where σ ← λz: 1 ÷ (1 + e^(-z))

# Functional programming
map ← λ(f, list):
    |list| = 0 ? [] : [f(list[0])] + map(f, list[1:])

∀ x ∈ map(λn: n², [1,2,3,4,5]) : 📤(x)
```

## Why Release a Parser Without Execution?

We believe the core innovation of MPL is proving that mathematical notation can replace English keywords. By releasing the parser, we demonstrate this is grammatically possible and invite the community to help build the rest.

The parser alone proves several key points:
- Mathematical symbols can express all programming constructs
- A language without English keywords is technically feasible  
- The grammar handles real complexity with zero ambiguities
- ASCII fallbacks make it universally typeable

Sometimes the idea is more important than the implementation. By sharing MPL now, we hope to inspire others to think differently about programming languages and who they exclude.

## 🌟 Why This Matters

### The Vision

Imagine a world where:
- A teacher in Beijing could explain loops using ∀ instead of `for`
- A parent in Mumbai could understand their child's code without knowing English
- Education ministers could provide programming education without requiring English literacy

These aren't testimonials - they're possibilities we're working toward. MPL is still just a parser, but it proves that programming without English is possible.

## 🚀 The inspiration

The idea for MPL came from a simple observation: children worldwide learn the same mathematical symbols (+, -, ×, ÷, =) but must learn English to program. This creates an unnecessary barrier.

Imagine a student asking: *"Why do I need to know English to tell a computer what to do? I know math. Isn't that enough?"*

This hypothetical question captures the essence of MPL. Mathematical thinking IS enough. We're building this proof of concept to demonstrate it's possible.

## 🔬 Cognitive science foundation

<details>
<summary>Why mathematical symbols work universally (click to expand)</summary>

### Symbolic universality

Mathematical notation evolved over millennia to be:
- **Culture-agnostic** — Symbols transcend linguistic boundaries
- **Cognitively efficient** — Direct concept-to-symbol mapping
- **Progressively learnable** — Builds on existing knowledge

### Neurological evidence

fMRI studies show mathematical symbol processing activates language-independent brain regions, enabling comprehension without linguistic translation.

### Pedagogical advantages

1. **Reduced cognitive load** — Single-step comprehension
2. **Transfer learning** — Math knowledge directly applies
3. **Cultural preservation** — Think in your native language
4. **Universal collaboration** — Code readable globally
