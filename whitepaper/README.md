## Key Features Documented

- **70+ Mathematical Symbols**: Complete Unicode operators with ASCII escapes
- **11 Effect Operators**: Novel symbols for exceptions, concurrency, resources
- **24 Greek Variables**: Full Greek alphabet for identifiers
- **Zero Ambiguities**: Validated grammar with precedence rules
- **Paradigm Coverage**: Functional, imperative, concurrent, OO, metaprogramming

## Building the LaTeX Version

```bash
# Requires XeLaTeX for Unicode support
xelatex mpl-whitepaper.tex
bibtex mpl-whitepaper
xelatex mpl-whitepaper.tex
xelatex mpl-whitepaper.tex
```

### LaTeX Requirements

- **XeLaTeX**: Required for Unicode support (not pdflatex)
- **unicode-math package**: For mathematical symbols
- **fontspec package**: For font configuration
- **newunicodechar package**: For symbol fallbacks

The LaTeX version includes fallback definitions for all MPL-specific Unicode symbols to ensure compatibility across different LaTeX installations. If symbols still don't render properly, check that Latin Modern Math font is installed.

## Target Venues

- POPL (Principles of Programming Languages)
- OOPSLA (Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages & Applications)
- PLDI (Programming Language Design and Implementation)
- Onward! (New ideas in programming)
